This is my portfolio for presenting some of my own projects.

Short description for each project :

Banking_Sistem - this is my most complex project, a banking software, I designed this application using OOP Inheritance and polymorphism.
 Hangman - is a simple game in console, it was a milestone for me in terms of the complexity of a applicattion that I can program.
